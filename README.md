# PolyPal
*PolyPal* is a Python package designed as a collaborative tool to assist with the creation, parameterization, and running of amorphous polymer simulations. The current version is designed to take quantum mechanically augmented force fields generated by Q-Force, create input files for Assemble!, and then generate files that can be directly submitted to GROMACS. Future versions will expand to different software. Source code is distributed along with a documentation guide that includes a tutorial.
It was made by Molly C. Warndorf under the guidance of Timothy M. Swager and Alfredo Alexander-Katz at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
